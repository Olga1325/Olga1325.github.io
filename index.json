It allows you to return files to the state they were before the changes, return the project to its original state, see the changes, see who last changed something and caused the problem, who set the task and when, and much more. Using VCS also generally means that if you break something or lose files, you can easily fix it. In addition to everything, you will get all this without any additional effort.\nLocal version control systems Many people use copying files into a separate directory as a version control method (perhaps even a timestamped directory, if they’re smart enough). This approach is very common due to its simplicity, but it is incredibly error prone. It’s easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally change the wrong file or copy the wrong files.\nTo solve this problem, programmers long ago developed local VCSs with a simple database that keeps a record of all changes to files, thus providing revision control.\nfigure 1. Local version control\nOne of the popular VCS was the RCS system, which is still distributed with many computers today. RCS stores sets of patches (differences between files) on disk in a special format, using which it can recreate the state of each file at a given point in time.\nCentralized version control systems The next big problem people face is the need to interact with other developers. In order to deal with it, centralized version control systems (TSKV) were developed. Systems such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce use a single server that holds all versions of files, and a number of clients that retrieve files from this centralized repository. The use of CSCR has been the standard for many years.\nfigure 2. Centralized version control\nThis approach has many advantages, especially over local SLE. For example, all project developers know to some extent what each of them does. Administrators have complete control over who can do what, and it’s much easier to administer the CSCM than it is to operate local databases on each client.\nDespite this, this approach also has serious disadvantages. The most obvious downside is the single point of failure represented by the centralized server. If that server goes down for an hour, during that time no one will be able to use version control to save the changes they are working on, and no one will be able to share those changes with other developers. If the hard disk where the central database is stored is damaged and there are no timely backups, you will lose everything—the entire history of the project, not counting the single snapshots of the repository that were saved on the local machines of the developers. Local VCS suffer from the same problem: when all project history is stored in one place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed version control systems This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DCCS) come into play. In RSCRs (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Darcs), clients don’t just download a snapshot of all files (the state of the files at a particular point in time)——they copy the entire repository. In this case, if one of the servers through which the developers communicated dies, any client repository can be copied to another server to continue working. Each copy of the repository is a complete backup of all data.\nFigure 3. Distributed version control\nWhat’s more, many RSVCs can interact with multiple remote repositories at the same time, so you can work with different groups of people using different approaches at the same time within the same project. This allows you to apply several development approaches at once, for example, hierarchical models, which is completely impossible in centralized systems.\nA Brief History of Git Like many things in life, Git started off with a bit of creative chaos and heated debate.\nThe Linux kernel is a fairly large open source project. For most of the development of the Linux kernel (1991-2002), changes were passed between developers in the form of patches and archives. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using BitKeeper, a proprietary decentralized VCS.\nIn 2005, the relationship between the Linux kernel development community and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper ended, and the free utility became unusable. This prompted the Linux kernel community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own utility, taking into account the lessons learned from working with BitKeeper. Some of the goals pursued by the new system were:\n- Speed - simple architecture - Good support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches) - Complete decentralization - Ability to effectively manage large projects such as the Linux kernel (speed and reasonable disk space usage) …","date":1678665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678665600,"objectID":"b51c39c0ac0ec5a38bb139cda30bb055","permalink":"https://example.com/post/git/","publishdate":"2023-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome 👋 We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial content to help you get familiar with everything in no time.","tags":["Git"],"title":"Version control.

Comparative characteris tics of known systems are resulted. On an example of one of them (Zotero) the deci sion of problems of creation of the list of the used sources in accordance with GOST 7.1-2003 is considered. all this without any additional effort.\nIn the course of scientific research, it is necessary to carry out a review of many published works in the field under study. At This accumulates a large number of references to documents, saves them full texts in electronic (and sometimes in paper) form. When it comes time of writing a scientific report, monograph or article, there are many in questions. How to navigate in the accumulated amount of information? How to make a list of used sources in the presence of times ny state standards and requirements of publishers?\nSolving the problem of systematic work with bibliography allows bibliographic information management systems (BIS, reference man age software). Bibliographic information management systems for allow to create, store and reuse bibliographic references, forming lists of sources used in scientific articles, monographs, books and reports.\nThe use of SUBI is justified, since when studying the ratio the number of published scientific papers to the number of downloaded full texts from electronic periodicals signed by universities (according to the statistics of the leading euro Russian, American and Russian universities), per scientific publication with there are from 90 to 120 uploaded articles. Number of libraries viewed there are even more graphic descriptions as a result of searching and reading information. In the process of comprehending the information found, a large set of notes that can be used to write scientific articles. Ve Note-taking can be done in SUBI and obtained from the collected records article drafts.\nYou can enter bibliographic information about documents manually. But most search engines for scientific resources (Google Scholar, SCOPUS, WoK, etc.) and e-journal access platforms (ScienceDirect, Sprin- gerLink, etc.) allow you to get a bibliographic description in a format up to allowing direct import to SUBI.\nSUIS includes a database and a system for generating selected references in formats defined by the standards or rules adopted by the publisher properties. Integration with well-known word processors allows you to arrange links according to the text of a scientific work and automatically generate tion of the list of sources used. A number of systems have the ability to port (export) elements of bibliographic references from the biblio graphical databases and websites, enable collaboration and access to the database from any computer connected to the Internet.\nAt present, many such systems are known; some of them for a number of parameters. The first to appear were nye proprietary (proprietary, non-free) library management systems graphic information:\nBookends (appeared in 1983, developer Sonny Software, price $99); Reference Manager (appeared in 1984, developed by Thomson Reuters, price $239.95); EndNote (appeared in 1988, developed by Thomson Reuters, price $299.95); Biblioscape (appeared in 1998, developer CG Information, price $79- $299); RefWorks (appeared in 2001, developer RefWorks, price $100 for year). There are much more free (free) systems (about 20). Some of they appeared just a few years ago and, in terms of their capabilities, are not blunt proprietary. Let’s dwell on the two most popular systems in recent times. bibliographic information management: Zotero (introduced in 2006, developer Center for History and New Media at GMU, site www.zotero.org) and Mendeley (appeared in 2008, developed by Mendeley, website www.mendeley.com). The advantages of Zotero and Mendeley include following:\nfree to use (although Mendeley, unlike Zotero, proprietary system due to closed source code); saving bibliographic information “on the fly” when viewing sites (you can automatically add bibliographic elements to the database) information, for example, through the RIS or BibTeX format); automatic saving together with the bibliography of the full text of a hundred tii in PDF or HTML formats (if available); the ability to create a bibliography in MS Word, OpenOffice Writer and other word processors; multi-platform (the ability to work under different operating systems); the ability to synchronize with the server to store the database. Both SUBIs use style files in csl format configured for different requirements of publishers for the design of the bibliography. There is even food A.A. Chetverikov style files according to GOST R 7.0.5-2008. However for scientific reports and works, GOST 7.1-2003 should be used. There are differences between the SUBI data. In favor of Zotero at the moment there is three arguments:\nmore stable operation (this is indirectly …","date":1678665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678665600,"objectID":"5009b8e49ab98c80b076a79102b1e83b","permalink":"https://example.com/post/working-with-bibliography/","publishdate":"2023-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/working-with-bibliography/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome 👋 We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial content to help you get familiar with everything in no time.","tags":["Working with bibliography"],"title":"Working with bibliography","type":"post"},{"authors":["Pronyakova Olga"],"categories":["post 2"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview This week we have a new teacher in mathematical analysis.

They wanted to come up with the simplest and most convenient markup language with which text can be translated into a beautifully designed look. At the same time, the text must remain readable even without being reduced to a “beautiful” look. This is what Markdown turned out to be. It was created in 2004, but the language has gained the most popularity now. It is supported by a variety of blogging platforms, note-taking services, CMS, and even instant messengers. Therefore, markdown is useful for everyone who deals with the web, from developers to bloggers.\nHow to use the markup language\nA person writes text in any editor and adds special combinations of standard characters to it. This is the markup, it shows where the text should be bold, where the heading should be, and where the list should be. Symbols can be used to mark up headings, text highlights, and even complex structures like tables. Special converters form a finished document based on the markup. It’s similar to using HTML, but the markdown is simpler and the text is more readable. Converters are either pre-installed in a text editor, such as a note-taking app, or are downloaded separately.\nWho Uses Markdown\nInternet users who communicate in instant messengers and write notes in services that support markup. Developers who write documentation for projects using markdown need a simple and reliable tool. Content managers when filling sites that support markdown. The markup can also be used on web pages. Bloggers who write longreads when they design materials for articles. Many writing platforms support markdown, such as Notion. Writers and copywriters who want a simple text styling tool - markup that is readable on any device. Enthusiasts who use markup for personal purposes: write notes and to-do lists, keep diaries or create memory cards.\nWhat is Markdown for?\nQuickly format an article to translate to PDF or just look nice with no extra effort. Layout of a text document for placement on the site, but without the use of HTML. Writing documentation for the code. Making notes in a personal digital notebook. Writing beautiful messages in messengers.\nMarkup rules\nBasic syntax. It is very simple: the text is “wrapped” in characters or they are placed before the line. This is how the headers will look like.\n“#” Heading H1 (first level, for example the title of the text)\n“##” Heading H2 (second level headings)\n“###” Heading H3 (third level, intermediate subheadings)\nAnd so on, up to the sixth-level headings with six hashes in front of the line. In practice, subheadings below H3 are practically not used.\nIn markdown, you can apply basic text formatting. You can’t insert a capital letter or handwritten font, but it’s easy to highlight important areas.\nItalics or italics\nBold text or bold text\nBold and underlined text\nQuote (an angle bracket is placed before each line of the quote)\nBulleted list item “1.” First item of a numbered list\n“2.” The second item of the numbered list (and so on)\nInserting materials. The markup allows you to insert different elements into the text: links and images, which are then “pulled up” into the document when formatting is applied. [link_text](any link) to insert links\n[image caption](link to image) to insert images into text\n***, - or ___ - a horizontal line on the entire line that separates part of the text from another\nAnd if the text should contain an asterisk or any other “special” character that can be read wrong, you must put a backslash in front of it. For example, like this: *. Then the character will be displayed in the text as it should and is not considered as a markup rule.\nExtended syntax. There is an extended version of markdown. It’s called GFM, GitHub Flavored Markdown. It has other interesting features, such as strikethrough text wrapped in two tildes, or a short code snippet. A multi-line block of code wraps in three gravis above the top line and below the bottom line. Like this: “`\nThere will be a line of code here.\nAnd here too.\n“`\nYou can create tables based on vertical and horizontal bar characters. Or “to-do lists”:\nCompleted Deed — [ ] Backlog\nIf the editor supports GFM, then all such syntax elements will also be converted and will look like on a web page. It even has emojis: you just need to insert the code of the desired emoticon wrapped in colons into the text. Something like this: 😄. Emoji codes are in the public domain, they can be viewed on the Internet.\nHow to get started with markdown It’s very simple: you need to install or open any editor that supports this markup and start writing. There are local editors, they need to be downloaded, and there are those that work in the browser via the Internet, like a web service. Choose any, customize to your needs and get started. The syntax is simple and easy to learn. It may even be that you already partially use it: for …","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"a0ade9b4b218a8a455292eee739b86e8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome 👋 We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial content to help you get familiar with everything in no time.","tags":["Markdown"],"title":"Markdown","type":"post"},{"authors":["Pronyakova Olga"],"categories":["post 5"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview bash Unix shell scripting, created by Ken Thompson in the early 1970s, is closely related to the C programming language. Bash, an updated Unix shell, was first released in the late 80s and is still under active development. Bash is typically scripted for server configuration, so it’s a good choice for modern cloud environments with containerized storage and microservices. Shell scripts are used quite often, so knowledge of this language is useful.\nAlso worth noting is zsh, which is currently the default shell on macOS.\nApplications: server administration, CLI tools, DevOps, virtualization.\nCOBOL One of the oldest languages ​​still in use today was created by Grace Hopper in the late 1950s and was intended to standardize the development of large-scale business applications on computers. A brilliant concept that is still used today in cross-platform SDKs. An incredible 95% of ATM transactions go through COBOL systems, with many of these devices operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Device vendors such as IBM develop more powerful COBOL machines but continue to maintain and upgrade existing systems due to the cost and risk of replacing them. COBOL isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. This is a good choice for those who want to work with clients from the financial sector.\nApplications: banking/finance, international corporations, governments.\nC/C++ These languages ​​often occupy the top of various ratings - they are valued for their power and speed. C was created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C++ was developed by Bjorn Stroustrup in 1985. Today, these two languages ​​underpin everything from operating systems and games to modern scientific computing and machine learning. C and C++ are well suited for demanding applications that value low-level hardware access and performance. Learning these languages ​​takes time and effort.\nScope: OS / SDK development, embedded devices, game engines, science.\nC# C#, released by Microsoft in 2000, was developed by Anders Hejlsberg as a cross-platform object-oriented programming language. It is now often used to develop business applications, APIs, games, and more. Due to its wide feature set, this language is suitable for graphics and other asynchronous programming tasks.\nApplications: corporate applications, software and user interface development, games, graphics.\nDart A modern language developed by Google for building mobile, desktop, web and server applications. Its creator Lars Bak also came up with the JavaSript Engine V8. Dart resembles other modern object-oriented programming languages ​​- C#, TypeScript, and Java - and provides a rich set of features suitable for defining complex interactions, asynchronous operations, animations, and other tasks.\nApplications: cross-platform applications, cloud services / enterprise systems, games, graphics.\nFortran Fortran, developed at IBM in the 1950s by John Backus, is a general-purpose language that was created for scientific and engineering work. It is still widely used for these purposes, including benchmark testing of the world’s fastest supercomputers. It has also been applied in space and physics research and weather modeling.\nApplications: aerospace/defense, scientific computing, numerical analysis.\nJava Java is a general-purpose OOP language developed in the 1990s by James Gosling at Sun (now owned by Oracle) and designed to be compiled into bytecode to run on the Java virtual machine. By 2020, this includes almost every kind of device, from TVs and game consoles to servers, phones and even kitchen appliances. The language is widely used in corporations and universities, which has made it popular among both novice programmers and experienced developers.\nApplications: enterprise applications, embedded systems, web services, games.\nJavaScript JavaScript was developed by Brandon Eich in the 1990s to add scripting to websites. Today it is a universal web interface language with powerful, standardized features that are supported by all major browsers. JavaScript conforms to the EcmaScript standard, which is updated every few years with new language specifications. In addition, JavaScript is often used to develop back-end services and APIs, mobile applications, games, and other software. This is an excellent choice for learning and further improvement.\nApplications: full-stack development, cloud services / container storage, games, utilities.\nJulia A modern high-level language designed for high-performance numerical processing and statistical analysis. Julia was developed in 2009 by Jeff Besanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah and Alan Edelman. It is one of four languages ​​that can achieve petaflops of supercomputing performance (along with C, C++, and Fortran). Popular with universities, governments and financial institutions.\nApplications: financial analysis, mathematical research, scientific computing.\nKotlin Designed to interact with Java, Kotlin is packed with functional …","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"78abcd895843b958198601b9d6769b93","permalink":"https://example.com/post/scientific-programming-languages/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/scientific-programming-languages/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome 👋 We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial content to help you get familiar with everything in no time.","tags":["Scientific programming languages"],"title":"Scientific programming languages","type":"post"},{"authors":["Pronyakova Olga","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
