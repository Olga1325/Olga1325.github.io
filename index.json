It allows you to return files to the state they were before the changes, return the project to its original state, see the changes, see who last changed something and caused the problem, who set the task and when, and much more. Using VCS also generally means that if you break something or lose files, you can easily fix it. In addition to everything, you will get all this without any additional effort.\nLocal version control systems Many people use copying files into a separate directory as a version control method (perhaps even a timestamped directory, if they’re smart enough). This approach is very common due to its simplicity, but it is incredibly error prone. It’s easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally change the wrong file or copy the wrong files.\nTo solve this problem, programmers long ago developed local VCSs with a simple database that keeps a record of all changes to files, thus providing revision control.\nfigure 1. Local version control\nOne of the popular VCS was the RCS system, which is still distributed with many computers today. RCS stores sets of patches (differences between files) on disk in a special format, using which it can recreate the state of each file at a given point in time.\nCentralized version control systems The next big problem people face is the need to interact with other developers. In order to deal with it, centralized version control systems (TSKV) were developed. Systems such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce use a single server that holds all versions of files, and a number of clients that retrieve files from this centralized repository. The use of CSCR has been the standard for many years.\nfigure 2. Centralized version control\nThis approach has many advantages, especially over local SLE. For example, all project developers know to some extent what each of them does. Administrators have complete control over who can do what, and it’s much easier to administer the CSCM than it is to operate local databases on each client.\nDespite this, this approach also has serious disadvantages. The most obvious downside is the single point of failure represented by the centralized server. If that server goes down for an hour, during that time no one will be able to use version control to save the changes they are working on, and no one will be able to share those changes with other developers. If the hard disk where the central database is stored is damaged and there are no timely backups, you will lose everything—the entire history of the project, not counting the single snapshots of the repository that were saved on the local machines of the developers. Local VCS suffer from the same problem: when all project history is stored in one place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed version control systems This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DCCS) come into play. In RSCRs (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Darcs), clients don’t just download a snapshot of all files (the state of the files at a particular point in time)——they copy the entire repository. In this case, if one of the servers through which the developers communicated dies, any client repository can be copied to another server to continue working. Each copy of the repository is a complete backup of all data.\nFigure 3. Distributed version control\nWhat’s more, many RSVCs can interact with multiple remote repositories at the same time, so you can work with different groups of people using different approaches at the same time within the same project. This allows you to apply several development approaches at once, for example, hierarchical models, which is completely impossible in centralized systems.\nA Brief History of Git Like many things in life, Git started off with a bit of creative chaos and heated debate.\nThe Linux kernel is a fairly large open source project. For most of the development of the Linux kernel (1991-2002), changes were passed between developers in the form of patches and archives. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using BitKeeper, a proprietary decentralized VCS.\nIn 2005, the relationship between the Linux kernel development community and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper ended, and the free utility became unusable. This prompted the Linux kernel community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own utility, taking into account the lessons learned from working with BitKeeper. Some of the goals pursued by the new system were:\n- Speed - simple architecture - Good support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches) - Complete decentralization - Ability to effectively manage large projects such as the Linux kernel (speed and reasonable disk space usage) …","date":1678665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678665600,"objectID":"b51c39c0ac0ec5a38bb139cda30bb055","permalink":"https://example.com/post/git/","publishdate":"2023-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome 👋 We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial content to help you get familiar with everything in no time.","tags":["Git"],"title":"Version control.

Comparative characteris tics of known systems are resulted. On an example of one of them (Zotero) the deci sion of problems of creation of the list of the used sources in accordance with GOST 7.1-2003 is considered. all this without any additional effort.\nIn the course of scientific research, it is necessary to carry out a review of many published works in the field under study. At This accumulates a large number of references to documents, saves them full texts in electronic (and sometimes in paper) form. When it comes time of writing a scientific report, monograph or article, there are many in questions. How to navigate in the accumulated amount of information? How to make a list of used sources in the presence of times ny state standards and requirements of publishers?\nSolving the problem of systematic work with bibliography allows bibliographic information management systems (BIS, reference man age software). Bibliographic information management systems for allow to create, store and reuse bibliographic references, forming lists of sources used in scientific articles, monographs, books and reports.\nThe use of SUBI is justified, since when studying the ratio the number of published scientific papers to the number of downloaded full texts from electronic periodicals signed by universities (according to the statistics of the leading euro Russian, American and Russian universities), per scientific publication with there are from 90 to 120 uploaded articles. Number of libraries viewed there are even more graphic descriptions as a result of searching and reading information. In the process of comprehending the information found, a large set of notes that can be used to write scientific articles. Ve Note-taking can be done in SUBI and obtained from the collected records article drafts.\nYou can enter bibliographic information about documents manually. But most search engines for scientific resources (Google Scholar, SCOPUS, WoK, etc.) and e-journal access platforms (ScienceDirect, Sprin- gerLink, etc.) allow you to get a bibliographic description in a format up to allowing direct import to SUBI.\nSUIS includes a database and a system for generating selected references in formats defined by the standards or rules adopted by the publisher properties. Integration with well-known word processors allows you to arrange links according to the text of a scientific work and automatically generate tion of the list of sources used. A number of systems have the ability to port (export) elements of bibliographic references from the biblio graphical databases and websites, enable collaboration and access to the database from any computer connected to the Internet.\nAt present, many such systems are known; some of them for a number of parameters. The first to appear were nye proprietary (proprietary, non-free) library management systems graphic information:\nBookends (appeared in 1983, developer Sonny Software, price $99); Reference Manager (appeared in 1984, developed by Thomson Reuters, price $239.95); EndNote (appeared in 1988, developed by Thomson Reuters, price $299.95); Biblioscape (appeared in 1998, developer CG Information, price $79- $299); RefWorks (appeared in 2001, developer RefWorks, price $100 for year). There are much more free (free) systems (about 20). Some of they appeared just a few years ago and, in terms of their capabilities, are not blunt proprietary. Let’s dwell on the two most popular systems in recent times. bibliographic information management: Zotero (introduced in 2006, developer Center for History and New Media at GMU, site www.zotero.org) and Mendeley (appeared in 2008, developed by Mendeley, website www.mendeley.com). The advantages of Zotero and Mendeley include following:\nfree to use (although Mendeley, unlike Zotero, proprietary system due to closed source code); saving bibliographic information “on the fly” when viewing sites (you can automatically add bibliographic elements to the database) information, for example, through the RIS or BibTeX format); automatic saving together with the bibliography of the full text of a hundred tii in PDF or HTML formats (if available); the ability to create a bibliography in MS Word, OpenOffice Writer and other word processors; multi-platform (the ability to work under different operating systems); the ability to synchronize with the server to store the database. Both SUBIs use style files in csl format configured for different requirements of publishers for the design of the bibliography. There is even food A.A. Chetverikov style files according to GOST R 7.0.5-2008. However for scientific reports and works, GOST 7.1-2003 should be used. There are differences between the SUBI data.

They wanted to come up with the simplest and most convenient markup language with which text can be translated into a beautifully designed look. At the same time, the text must remain readable even without being reduced to a “beautiful” look. This is what Markdown turned out to be. It was created in 2004, but the language has gained the most popularity now. It is supported by a variety of blogging platforms, note-taking services, CMS, and even instant messengers. Therefore, markdown is useful for everyone who deals with the web, from developers to bloggers.\nHow to use the markup language\nA person writes text in any editor and adds special combinations of standard characters to it. This is the markup, it shows where the text should be bold, where the heading should be, and where the list should be. Symbols can be used to mark up headings, text highlights, and even complex structures like tables. Special converters form a finished document based on the markup. It’s similar to using HTML, but the markdown is simpler and the text is more readable. Converters are either pre-installed in a text editor, such as a note-taking app, or are downloaded separately.\nWho Uses Markdown\nInternet users who communicate in instant messengers and write notes in services that support markup. Developers who write documentation for projects using markdown need a simple and reliable tool. Content managers when filling sites that support markdown. The markup can also be used on web pages. Bloggers who write longreads when they design materials for articles. Many writing platforms support markdown, such as Notion. Writers and copywriters who want a simple text styling tool - markup that is readable on any device. Enthusiasts who use markup for personal purposes: write notes and to-do lists, keep diaries or create memory cards.\nWhat is Markdown for?\nQuickly format an article to translate to PDF or just look nice with no extra effort. Layout of a text document for placement on the site, but without the use of HTML. Writing documentation for the code. Making notes in a personal digital notebook. Writing beautiful messages in messengers.\nMarkup rules\nBasic syntax. It is very simple: the text is “wrapped” in characters or they are placed before the line. This is how the headers will look like.\n“#” Heading H1 (first level, for example the title of the text)\n“##” Heading H2 (second level headings)\n“###” Heading H3 (third level, intermediate subheadings)\nAnd so on, up to the sixth-level headings with six hashes in front of the line. In practice, subheadings below H3 are practically not used.\nIn markdown, you can apply basic text formatting. You can’t insert a capital letter or handwritten font, but it’s easy to highlight important areas.\nItalics or italics\nBold text or bold text\nBold and underlined text\nQuote (an angle bracket is placed before each line of the quote)\nBulleted list item “1.” First item of a numbered list\n“2.” The second item of the numbered list (and so on)\nInserting materials. The markup allows you to insert different elements into the text: links and images, which are then “pulled up” into the document when formatting is applied. [link_text](any link) to insert links\n[image caption](link to image) to insert images into text\n***, - or ___ - a horizontal line on the entire line that separates part of the text from another\nAnd if the text should contain an asterisk or any other “special” character that can be read wrong, you must put a backslash in front of it. For example, like this: *. Then the character will be displayed in the text as it should and is not considered as a markup rule.\nExtended syntax. There is an extended version of markdown. It’s called GFM, GitHub Flavored Markdown. It has other interesting features, such as strikethrough text wrapped in two tildes, or a short code snippet. A multi-line block of code wraps in three gravis above the top line and below the bottom line. Like this: “`\nThere will be a line of code here.\nAnd here too.\n“`\nYou can create tables based on vertical and horizontal bar characters. Or “to-do lists”:\nCompleted Deed — [ ] Backlog\nIf the editor supports GFM, then all such syntax elements will also be converted and will look like on a web page. It even has emojis: you just need to insert the code of the desired emoticon wrapped in colons into the text. Something like this: 😄. Emoji codes are in the public domain, they can be viewed on the Internet.\nHow to get started with markdown It’s very simple: you need to install or open any editor that supports this markup and start writing. There are local editors, they need to be downloaded, and there are those that work in the browser via the Internet, like a web service. Choose any, customize to your needs and get started. The syntax is simple and easy to learn. It may even be that you already partially use it: for …","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"a0ade9b4b218a8a455292eee739b86e8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome 👋 We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial content to help you get familiar with everything in no time.","tags":["Markdown"],"title":"Markdown","type":"post"},{"authors":["Pronyakova Olga","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
